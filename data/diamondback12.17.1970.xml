It must also be noted that this person group risks projecting understandings of race onto groups whose diversity is invisible or unapparent to a reader removed through decades of history, or groups that include passing individuals who deliberately silenced themselves regarding their identities.</note>

      <p>
        <orgName ref="#SGA">Student Government Association</orgName> Legislature voted last night to conduct an <interp ana="#NAMED">Investigation</interp> into the present <orgName ref="#CL">cheerleader</orgName> selection process because of <interp ana="#SILENCE">alleged</interp> racial discrimination.</p>
      <p>
        Legislator <persName xml:id="CW"><forename>Cheryl</forename> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>, who proposed the <interp ana="#NAMED">Investigation</interp>, charged the 12-member cheerleader selection panel practiced a “<q who="#CW"><choice><orig>blatent</orig><reg>blatant</reg></choice> <interp ana="#NAMED">form of institutional racism</interp></q>” because <interp ana="#ABSENCE">it did not select any of the seven
        </interp>
        <persName ref="#BLKWM">blacks</persName> who tried out for the seven vacant positions on the 10-girl squad.</p>
      <p>
        According to <persName ref="#CW">Williams</persName>, two of the seven <persName ref="#BLKWM">blacks</persName> made it to the top ten but were not among the <persName ref="#WHTWM">girls</persName> chosen to fill out the squad. <interp ana="#ABSENCE">The squad will have no black members next year</interp>.</p>
      <p>
        Last <date when="1969-12">December</date> <persName xml:id="AS"><forename>Angie</forename> <surname>Sharp</surname></persName> and <persName xml:id="JR"><forename>Jacqueline</forename> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName> became the <interp ana="#NAMED">first black cheerleaders</interp> on the squad in <interp ana="#ABSENCE">30 years</interp>.
        <persName ref="#JR">Robinson</persName> dropped off the squad
        <date when="1969">last year</date>; <persName ref="#AS">Sharp</persName> will leave in <date when="1971-06">June</date>.</p>
      <p>

        <interp ana="#SILENCE"/><!-- Though ostensibly an article about the legislature's actions regarding the cheerleading squad's discriminatory behavior, only the first half of the article concerns this story, so the second half of the article is enforcing a silence by changing the subject-->

        In addition, <orgName ref="#SGA">legislature</orgName> is now drawing up a proposal concerning the student activity fee to present to Chancel­lor <persName xml:id="CEB"><forename type="first">Charles</forename> E. <surname>Bishop</surname></persName>’s committee which <choice><orig>Is</orig><reg>is</reg></choice> studying the question of how the fee should be collected and distributed.</p>
    <cb n="2"/>
      <p>
        The proposal under consideration will recommend that the fee remain mandatory but that it be placed in a revolving account for <orgName type="acronym" ref="#SGA">SGA</orgName> use ex­clusively.</p>
      <p>
        The group also expressed concern for student library help.</p>
      <p>
        Legislator <persName xml:id="PL"><forename>Pat</forename> <surname>Leer</surname></persName> will head a committee which will meet with <persName ref="#CEB">Bishop</persName> to discuss obtaining funds for staffing the <orgName xml:id="UL">library</orgName> with more students to work in the stacks.</p>
      <p>
        <persName ref="#PL">Leer</persName>, who is a <orgName ref="#UL">library</orgName> employee, said the number of student workers has been cut because of a recent library budget cut by the <placeName ref="#UMD">University</placeName>. He claims the reduced amount of help will cause books to be shelved more slowly and make it impossible for students to locate books they need for course work.</p>
      <p>
        The <orgName ref="#SGA">legislature</orgName> also endorsed a move by <persName xml:id="JD"><forename>John</forename> <surname>Daly</surname></persName> that the <orgName xml:id="SUB">Student Union Board</orgName> join an association of Student Union Boards of colleges and universities in the <region type="DMV">greater <settlement>Washington</settlement> area</region>.
        The association, which will include <orgName xml:id="AU">American</orgName>, <orgName xml:id="CU">Catholic</orgName>, <orgName xml:id="GWU">George Washington</orgName> and <orgName xml:id="GU">Georgetown</orgName> Universities and <orgName xml:id="GMU">George Mason</orgName> College as well as the University, is being created to establish greater cooperation in the exchange of informationon student planned events.</p>
