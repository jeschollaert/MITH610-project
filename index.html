    <div id="description">
      <p class="ex">In creating the markup for this project, I hoped to foreground Saidiya Hartman's concept of critical fabulation, established in her 2008 article "Venus in Two Acts" as,</</p>
      <p class="ex2">"fashioning a narrative, which is based upon archival research… to tell an impossible story and to amplify the impossibility of its telling. […] The intention here isn't anything as miraculous as recovering the lives of the enslaved or redeeming the dead, but rather laboring to paint as full a picture of the lives of the captives as possible." (11)</p>
      <p class="ex">A project that created as intentionally digital and intentionally black engages with the critical fabulation necessary in re-imagining contexts, social environments, and language itself. Hartman developed the term as she explored ways to navigate the role of the impossibility of narrative in making sense of the "scandal and excess [that] inundate the archive" (5).</p>
