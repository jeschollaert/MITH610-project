    <h1>Silences, Absences, and Named Experiences in the <hi rend="italic">Diamondback</hi>'s Coverage of Cheerleading Discrimination</h1>
    <div id="description">
      <p class="ex1">Submitted by Jeannette Schollaert as Exercise 1: Reimagining the Archive for ENGL668: Critical Topics in Digital Studies, University of Maryland, Spring 2018</p>
      <p class="ex">In creating the markup for this project, I hoped to foreground Saidiya Hartman's concept of critical fabulation, established in her 2008 article "Venus in Two Acts." Hartman introduces critical fabulation as,
      </p>
      <p class="ex2">"fashioning a narrative, which is based upon archival research… to tell an impossible story and to amplify the impossibility of its telling. […] The intention here isn't anything as miraculous as recovering the lives of the enslaved or redeeming the dead, but rather laboring to paint as full a picture of the lives of the captives as possible." (11)
      </p>
      <p class="ex">A project that is created as intentionally digital and intentionally black must engage with the critical fabulation at work in re-imagining contexts, social environments, and language itself. Hartman developed the term as she explored ways to navigate the impossibility of narrative in making sense of the "scandal and excess [that] inundate the archive," and her example is useful in considering how best to represent impossible narratives across historical and cultural contexts (5).
      </p>
      <p class="ex">Though my project considers archival material from a markedly different historical context than Hartman's work, the impossibility of narrative in situating stories remains. Instead of considering the word "Venus," this project poses the question of what is hiding in the term "cheerleader"? Whose bodies are allowed to carry that descriptor, follow that specific cultural script? Who is being implicitly and explicitly included or excluded from the term? How is student-authored journalism inherently limited and biased by authorial positionality in its portrayal of events? To this end, I chose to encode two articles published in two different academic semesters over the course of three academic years (spring of 1969 and fall of 1970, and 1968-1969, 1969-1970, and 1970-1971, respectively). Both articles engage with the controversy regarding the de-facto segregation of the University of Maryland cheerleading squad.
      </p>
      <p class="ex">These articles highlight different points in the history of segregation and discrimination in the cheerleading squad. By considering the two articles together, and allowing them to speak to one another, we can establish patterns of silences, absences, and named experiences in the archives of Maryland's student-reported history. I chose to trace silences, absences, and named experiences in response to Rodney G. S. Carter's article, "Of Things Said and Unsaid: Power, Archival Silences, and Power in Silence." I established personGroups for black women (#BLKWM) and white women (#WHTWM) to make explicit the identities that are either subsumed under limiting, monolithic shorthand terms such as "blacks," as well as the terms that construct race implicitly by perpetuating the assumption of whiteness as a "neutral" default. I marked nouns or concepts with persName references to trace the ways these two different experiences of womanhood are coded in the reporting of cheerleading discrimination. These persNames will appear underlined in red to represent references to black women, and blue to represent references to white women.
      Yet I must note that even this markup choice is inherently flawed, in that the my markup relies on my own study and understanding of popular stereotypes, critical interpretation of the available text, and awarness of the inherently biased reporting of the time. All of these layers, regardless of the amount of research, could still effectively hide the experiences of, for example, passing individuals who chose to keep their identities secret, alternative groups unrecognized by the official student newspaper, and other populations potentially ignored in the reporting process. My markup choices also inadvertently reify a raical binary of black and white women's histories, thus excluding the experience of women who do not identify clearly with either one of those positions.
      </p>
      <p class="ex">I also used interpretation groups to trace the larger ideas of silence, absence, and named experiences. These markups appear in italics throughout the text, to force the reader to pause and consider what assumptions, bodies, and evidence might be hidden within particular words and phrases. I noted certain forms of evidence as "named experience," such as references to bureaucratic materials such as briefs and investigations, as well as phrases from quotes. Yet I was struck by the fact that no cheerleaders or black women were quoted as part of these stories. Article 1 features a quote attributed to the cheerleaders as a whole - as this larger attribution allows individual women to avoid persecution or blame - but even when black women are named in Article 2, they either refused to supply quotes or were not asked for input. Two black women are named in the article, but there are no quotes to accompany these two names. I chose to note "silences" to indicate these, and other, absent voices, and "absences" when bodies are alluded to - as cheerleading is inherently concerned with the display and spectacle of certain bodies - but not included. I hesitate to project too much into the silences the articles contain, because as Carter notes, "Unnatural silences must be combated by the archivist, but natural silences, those where the marginalized can assert their own power, must be respected. […] In the face of those who wish to ignore, dismiss, and silence, to be silent is to be political" (228, 230). I hope to force "active participation by the readers/listeners" who visit this site by drawing attention to the potential silences, absences, and named experiences located in the italics (230).
      </p>
      <p class="ex">These two articles provide a small window into one of a number of impossible narratives in the impossibly rich history of the University of Maryland student newspaper archives. By tracing the assumptions of language through underlines, and the interpretation groups of silences, absences, and named experiences through italics, I hope to provide one more perspective to the work of reimagining the histories reported in the University of Maryland's student newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Diamondback</hi>.
